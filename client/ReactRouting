Alright so this text will teach you how to use React Routing effeciently, for your everyday
Web development use :)

import React, {useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter, Link, Routes, Route, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

<!-- Browser Router: Stores the Current browser address (Default endpoint is '/')

Link: is a Element that can be use to navigate the user to a different component when clicked

Routes: is a element that stores all of your endpoints etc '/Login', '/Signup', '/Menu'

Route: Is a element that creates a path to where your Components will be rendered

useNavigate: is a function that allow user to Navigate to a different endppoint. -->

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import $ from 'jquery';
import Index from './Index.jsx'



const App = () =>{


    return (

      <!-- So since the default endpoint is '/' then it will automatically render the Index Component -->

      <Routes>
        <Route path ='/' element = {<Index/>} />
      </Routes>



    )
  }

//export default App

ReactDOM.render(
<!--
  We would want to wrap our App Component in a <BrowserRouter> Component because it stores the website address/port -->

  <BrowserRouter >
  <App />
  </BrowserRouter>

, document.getElementById('app'))
